CambridgeSweepAreas
===================

This little project grew out of frustration in deciphering Cambridge, MA's
street sweeping schedule.  If you're a Cambridge resident going on vacation,
it's difficult to quickly determine where to park while you're away, unless
you don't mind being ticketed and towed.

The city's 
[street cleaning schedule and routes page](http://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/ourservices/streetcleaning/schedulesandroutes.aspx) links to a map displaying
the sweep areas.  The map has no labels.  In order to use the site you have
to keep open their map of the sweep areas, another street map to find the
actual boundaries and the web page containing the street sweep schedule.  This
will merge the schedule with GeoJSON of the street sweep areas so that they
can be viewed as one.
